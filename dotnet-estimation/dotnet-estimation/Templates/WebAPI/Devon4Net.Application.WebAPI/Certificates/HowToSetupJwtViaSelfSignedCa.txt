Requirements:
OpenSSL [https://github.com/openssl/openssl] toolkit

1. Step: Create a Certificate Authority:
First, we will need to create a Certificate Authority to sign the certificate. 
For that, we will run the following command which will create the certificate RootCA.pem and the corresponding private key RootCA.key.

openssl req -x509 -nodes -new -sha256 -days 1024 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout RootCA.key -out RootCA.pem -subj "/C=DE/ST=Hamburg/L=Hamburg/O=Certificates/CN=Devon4NetEstimationCertificate.local"

Now we will create the public key RootCA.crt for the certificate by running the following command:

openssl x509 -outform pem -in RootCA.pem -out RootCA.crt


If you want to export the certificate you can run the command:

openssl pkcs12 -export -out RootCA.pfx -inkey RootCA.key -in RootCA.crt

2. Step: Create a Certificate signing request and a private key
To create a new certificate run the following command:

//Create a certificate signing request (.csr) and a corresponding key
openssl req -new -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.csr -subj "/C=DE/ST=Hamburg/L=Hamburg/O=Certificates/CN=localhost.local"

Before signing the certificate, create a "domains.ext" that contains the following (only the content between the lines):
--------------------------
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = localhost
DNS.2 = localhost.local
DNS.3 = 127.0.0.1
DNS.4 = fake1.local
DNS.5 = fake2.local
--------------------------

3. Step: Sign the certificate
Once the files are created, you’ll need to sign the certificate with the CA we created earlier:

openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 1024 -in localhost.csr -CA RootCA.pem -CAkey RootCA.key -CAcreateserial -extfile domains.ext -out localhost.crt

Run the next command to export the certificate:

openssl pkcs12 -export -out localhost.pfx -inkey localhost.key -in localhost.crt
